"""Sensitive-data redaction filter per Round 3 § 6.1 + P5 + D6.

A ``logging.Filter`` subclass that redacts plaintext from log records BEFORE
they hit any sink. Installed on every handler at process start by
``log_handler`` (Round 3 § 6.2) so P5 (no plaintext PII anywhere in logs)
is enforced universally.

Default patterns
================

- ``password`` — anything of the form ``*_password = <value>`` (case-insensitive)
- ``rsa_private_key`` — full PEM-formatted private key blocks (multiline)
- ``gpg_passphrase`` — anything of the form ``passphrase = <value>``

Per-source PII patterns (SSN, account number, etc.) are added at runtime via
:func:`register_pii_pattern` by ``pii_tokenizer`` after reading
``UdmTablesList.PiiColumnList`` per D63.

Filter contract
===============

- Mutates ``record.msg`` and each ``record.args`` element in place.
- **Always returns True** — never drops a log line. Redaction, not suppression.
- On regex / unexpected exception during filtering, the record passes
  through with a synthetic ``<filter_failed>`` marker appended to
  ``record.msg``. This contract is per § 6.1 — losing a log line because
  the filter blew up is worse than emitting an unredacted log line, but
  emitting *something* is better than silence.
- Pattern compilation happens at module import (or via
  :func:`register_pii_pattern`). Compilation failure raises
  :class:`FilterConfigError` per D68 — module import fails so the operator
  sees the bad pattern before any log line writes.

Performance
===========

O(P × M) per record where P = pattern count and M = message length. Patterns
are compiled once and stored as read-only ``re.Pattern`` objects; per-record
cost is ~50 µs for the default pattern set. The filter is thread-safe — no
shared mutable state after import + any ``register_pii_pattern`` calls in
the single-threaded startup phase.

D-numbers consumed
==================

- P5 — no plaintext PII in logs
- D6 — PII tokenization (this filter complements the SP-based tokenizer)
- D67 — Tier 0 smoke discipline
- D68 — :class:`FilterConfigError` ⊂ PipelineFatalError
- D69 — stateless / thread-safe per process

B-numbers
=========

- Closes the M14 dependency referenced by every Round 3 / Round 4 module
  that installs a logging handler.
